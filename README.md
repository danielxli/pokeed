## Pack Opener (companion app)

`pack-opener/` is a separate, kid-friendly card-pack-opening game hosted at the
same origin under `/pack-opener/`. Players earn **Poké Coins** by answering math
and reading questions (reusing the main game's Training Grounds drills via a Web
Worker), spend them on real 1999 booster packs, rip the foil open, reveal cards
with holo effects, and fill a collection binder. The main game's map links to it
via the **Card Shop** card; it links back with a 🏠 button. It keeps its own
state (`localStorage` key `packrip.save.v1`) and shares no runtime state with the
main game. See [`pack-opener/README.md`](pack-opener/README.md) for full detail.

## Script Load Order

Scripts must load in this order (each depends on globals from previous):

1. **audio.js** — `SFX` object, `getAudio()`, `playTone()`
2. **data.js** — `TYPE_CHART`, `MOVES_DB`, `POKEMON_DB`, `GYMS`, questions/words
3. **engine.js** — `State`, `Game` object, `showScene()`, `notify()`, `addXp()`
4. **encounter.js** — `Game.goToEncounter()`, clue/challenge rendering, pokeball throw
5. **pokedex.js** — `Game.goToPokedex()`, `Game.goToLab()`, activity sessions
6. **battle.js** — `Game.goToGym()`, battle system, damage calc
7. **rocket.js** — `Game.goToRocket()`, puzzle types
8. **guide.js** — `Game.goToGuide()`, guide renderer
9. **settings.js** — `Game.openSettings()`, `LEVEL_DATA`, init
10. **activities.js** — `ACTIVITY_REGISTRY`, 26 generator functions
11. **systems.js** — `DDA`, `StreakTracker`, `DailyChallenge`, `Evolution`, `SessionTimer`, `Collab`

## Key Architecture

- **Single-page DOM app** — all scenes are `<div class="scene">` toggled via `showScene(id)`
- **Global state** — `State` object holds current scene, encounter data, caught pokemon, gym progress
- **`Game` namespace** — all scene transitions and actions are methods on the global `Game` object
- **151 Pokemon** — full Gen 1 database with types, stats, moves, and clues
- **14 types + effectiveness chart** — real Pokemon type matchups for gym battles
- **5 difficulty levels** — Pre-K through 4th grade, controlling question complexity
- **Sprites** — loaded from PokeAPI CDN, rendered with `image-rendering: pixelated`
- **No build step** — pure HTML/CSS/JS, deploy by copying files to any static host
